Abstract CLass:
-	A class declare with keyword “abstract ”is known as abstract class
-	Abstract is nothing but combination of Complete as well as Incomplete methods
-	 Incomplete method is method where declaration will present and definition will be absent.
 
-	We cannot create object of abstract class.
-	Programer can decalare incomplete method as as abstract method by declaring keyword abstract infront of incomplete method.
Ex:
// abstract is combination of complete as we as Incomplete method
abstract class Test 
{
	
	//Complete method : method defination and method declaration
	public void sample() 						
	{
		System.out.println("complete method ");
